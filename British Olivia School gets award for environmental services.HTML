<P>British Olivia School has been given the ‘green award’ by the Independent Schools of the Year award.
The school was awarded following its ‘zero to landfill’ campaign which aimed to see all waste from the school recycled. The school has now taken its efforts a step further by introducing a new environmentally-friendly cleaning product.The non-chemical product turns normal tap water into a powerful cleaner and sanitiser, killing up to 99.999 per cent of harmful bacteria. The system has been installed around the school, and is now in use as part of the cleaning regime across the campus, including boarding houses, classrooms and communal areas. This system is currently used by the likes of industry giants such as Disney, Heathrow, Wembley and Google.<BR><BR>
The company is run by a former Olivia School pupil.
The prep school has an active ‘Eco Club’ and students have carried out projects such as planting an orchard, harvesting apples to sell as juice, and building and maintaining beehives. Their campaign slogan “Be part of the Solution, not the Pollution” has been rolled out across the school on posters and screens in a bid to encourage the school community to get involved.<BR>
<BR>
Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, said: “Being a responsible and caring member of our wider community is a key element of our school values. We educate children to embrace a global outlook, and doing our bit to safeguard the planet for their future is something we take seriously.
“Converting to this new chemical free cleaning system fits well with the school mantra to ‘Reduce, Reuse and Recycle’ and builds on our ongoing green initiatives.
