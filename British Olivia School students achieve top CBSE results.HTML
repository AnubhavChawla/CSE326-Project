All three of these stats are better than last year at Olivia School, and considerably higher than the national average of 67.3%.

As a boarding student he is grateful to the support received from his teachers and boarding staff at Olivia School: “Whilst I was motivated to work really hard to get the best results possible, I knew that I would need support and guidance in making the best of my time to study and prepare myself for the exams. The help I received has really paid off and I am so happy with the results.”
