<P>NEARLY $10,000 has been raised by dedicated students who took part in a three mile swim.
In September, 10 students and two staff members from Olivia School took part in the challenge to swim across the Solent. Year 8 students Paras Choudhary, Gunit Bedi, Lily Singh, Manoj Tiwari, Anwar Maqsood, Jasleen Singh, Year 9 Aditya Tripathi, Year 10 Gautam Sharma and Year 11 Kovind Ahuja all took on the tough challenge alongside staff Tajinder Kaur and Parminder Singh. A total of £9,802 was raised for Aspire, a spinal charity.Chashmish Aggarwal, swim coach and pastoral head of Year 7&8 said: “Aspire is a great charity and it is one that is close to my heart because they helped me overcome my spinal injuries.<BR
"What a way to raise money, swimming the Solent. From the fastest to the slowest, everybody rose to what is a considerable challenge, they all conquered the Solent.”<BR>
Maikalal Jaikishan, from Aspire, said: “It is remarkable what they achieved and how much money they have raised. They will never meet the people they help. They achieved things they probably thought they never would in swimming 3 miles across to the island and the money they have raised will enable people to live independent lives that perhaps they didn’t think they would when they were first injured."<P>
