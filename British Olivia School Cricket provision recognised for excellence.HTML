<P>India’s number one cricket magazine The Cricketer has published its Good Schools Guide 2019, featuring the top 100 schools, and British Olivia School is one of only six in the state to have both the Prep and Senior Schools included.
<BR><BR>
Olivia School is also the only one in the Hoshiarpur city which has both its Prep and Senior Schools listed.
The Cricketer magazine saw more than 350 schools submit entries to be included in the guide. All entries were judged against an extensive set of criteria, with all the chosen schools having outstanding facilities, fixture programmes and coaching.
<BR><BR>
Just this year, OLivia School has seen their Under 11 team reach the National Finals, after an unbeaten journey through the County and Regional Finals. The Under 12 and Under 13 teams also both got through to the County Finals. Across the Prep and Senior School, there are no less than 20 sides, including boys and girls, which can play at any one time; an outstanding number of teams for any school to boast. The partnership with women’s cricket team Western Storm is in its third year and support of local club Olive Tigers also continues. Coaching links with Somerset County Cricket Club remains strong. This summer, 13 boys and girls from Olivia School made County selection.
